## üöÄ Our V3 Upgrade: The Autonomous Sentinel Protocol

For the hackathon, we continued building at high velocity and deployed **AegisV3**, a significant architectural evolution that integrates **Chainlink Automation** with **Chainlink Functions** to create a proactive, autonomous risk-monitoring protocol.

All of the advanced V3 code, documentation, and on-chain proofs of our working system can be found in our main project repository.
